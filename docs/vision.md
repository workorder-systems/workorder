# WorkOrder Vision

Maintenance software is meant to keep things running.

Over time, it became something else.

Paper work orders were replaced by digital tools. Those tools turned into SaaS platforms. Costs went up. Interfaces got heavier. Mobile apps stopped working the moment the internet dropped. Data ended up locked behind vendors, contracts, and roadmaps written far away from the people doing the work.

What followed is familiar: technicians work around the system, updates happen late or not at all, and maintenance becomes reactive instead of predictable.

## What we believe

Maintenance software should serve the operation — not control it.

The people responsible for uptime should be able to:

* do their work without fighting the tool
* rely on the system when conditions are bad, not just when everything is online
* see what actually happened, not a polished summary
* keep ownership of their data

## What WorkOrder is

WorkOrder is open-source maintenance software for teams that manage real assets.

It focuses on the basics done well:

* clear work orders
* understandable asset structure and history
* software that keeps working when connectivity is unreliable

WorkOrder is designed to be:

* **Offline-first** — work continues without internet
* **Data-owned** — you stay in control of your data
* **Open** — transparent, inspectable, and adaptable
* **Practical** — built for daily maintenance work

## What WorkOrder is not

WorkOrder is intentionally not:

* a bloated enterprise CMMS
* software built mainly for demos and sales calls
* a black box that locks away your data
* dependent on constant connectivity

If a feature does not make maintenance clearer or more reliable, it does not belong here.

## Why open source

WorkOrder is open source because maintenance software is critical to operations.

Open source allows teams to:

* run the software themselves
* adapt it to local processes
* audit how it works
* avoid vendor lock-in

If WorkOrder is offered as a hosted service, improvements should remain open.
That keeps the project fair to users and contributors.

## Who this is for

WorkOrder is built for:

* maintenance technicians
* planners and supervisors
* facility and operations managers
* developers supporting physical operations

## The goal

The goal of WorkOrder is simple.

Maintenance software should fade into the background.

When the system works, people trust it. History is clear. Surprises are reduced. Teams spend less time managing tools and more time maintaining assets.

WorkOrder exists to support that — and nothing more.
