# WorkOrder

Open-source maintenance software for teams that manage real assets.

**Works offline. You own your data. Built for daily maintenance work.**

## What WorkOrder is

WorkOrder is open-source maintenance software that focuses on the basics done well:

* Clear work orders
* Understandable asset structure and history
* Software that keeps working when connectivity is unreliable

WorkOrder is designed to be:
* **Offline-first** — work continues without internet
* **Data-owned** — you stay in control of your data
* **Open** — transparent, inspectable, and adaptable
* **Practical** — built for daily maintenance work

See [Vision](docs/vision.md) for more about what WorkOrder is and why it exists.
